# AlexaCalculator

An Alexa calculator skill that I wrote while doing a linkedIn course on alexa skills.

The course taught you how to make a calculator skill, I added an extra feature that would 
give you a fact about the resulting solution (only when performing addition for now) by 
making an HTTP call.
